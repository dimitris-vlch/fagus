SAMEA6663847	ERA2421664	Protocols: Roots were quickly separated from soil, washed under running tap water, rinsed with deionized water, dried with paper towel, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Young (approx. 7 to 8 years) Fagus sylvatica L. trees were collected at a natural regeneration forest with intact roots with original forest soil and litter layer. Trees were kept outdoors under ambient conditions, protected from rain but regularly watered with demineralized water (to keep soil moisture content at approx. 0.32 m³ water per m³ soil) and a shading net to simulate natural forest light conditions. Trees were randomly relocated on a weekly basis throughout the experiment to avoid confounding location or light effects. Trees were kept this way from March 7th to July 30th. In the Morning (ca. 7:00 am) of the two treatment days, 60 mL of either deionized water, 20 mM 15KNO3 solution or 20 mM 15NH4Cl solution were added to each treatment tree of the control group and the two treatment groups, respectively (120 mL total). Trees were harvested on day 3. RNA was extracted using the CTAB method of Chang et al. (1993). mRNA libraries were constructed using the NEBNext RNA Ultra II Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol.		PRJEB37750			Sample 2

SAMN00166437		Young seedlings (3 month) were grown in sterile water. 10 seedlings were infected with Phytophthora citricola and 10 were control plants with mock infection. The roots of the two groups were harvested after 6 days (infected plants showing symptoms) and each group's roots were pooled. Subtractive library: Driver = RNA from control roots 98.6% plus 1.4% P. citricola RNA (liquid culture) Tester = RNA from infected roots.

SAMN00166438		Young seedlings (3 month) were grown in sterile water. 10 seedlings were infected with Phytophthora citricola and 10 were control plants with mock infection. The roots of the two groups were harvested after 6 days (infected plants showing symptoms) and each group's roots were pooled. Subtractive library: Driver = RNA from control roots 97% plus P. citricola RNA (liquid culture) 3% Tester = RNA from infected roots.					SSH library of pathogen infected Fagus sylvatica roots 2

SAMEA6663842	ERA2421664	Protocols: Roots were quickly separated from soil, washed under running tap water, rinsed with deionized water, dried with paper towel, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Young (approx. 7 to 8 years) Fagus sylvatica L. trees were collected at a natural regeneration forest with intact roots with original forest soil and litter layer. Trees were kept outdoors under ambient conditions, protected from rain but regularly watered with demineralized water (to keep soil moisture content at approx. 0.32 m³ water per m³ soil) and a shading net to simulate natural forest light conditions. Trees were randomly relocated on a weekly basis throughout the experiment to avoid confounding location or light effects. Trees were kept this way from March 7th to July 30th. In the Morning (ca. 7:00 am) of the two treatment days, 60 mL of either deionized water, 20 mM 15KNO3 solution or 20 mM 15NH4Cl solution were added to each treatment tree of the control group and the two treatment groups, respectively (120 mL total). Trees were harvested on day 3. RNA was extracted using the CTAB method of Chang et al. (1993). mRNA libraries were constructed using the NEBNext RNA Ultra II Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol.		PRJEB37750			Sample 5

Frozen tissue was ground under liquid nitrogen in a ball mill (Retsch, Haan, Germany). Tissue powder (500 mg) was used for RNA extraction after Chang et al. (1993) with minor modifications: the extraction buffer contained 2% b-mercaptoethanol and no spermindine. RNA was purified (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands).

SAMEA6663844	ERA2421664	Protocols: Roots were quickly separated from soil, washed under running tap water, rinsed with deionized water, dried with paper towel, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Young (approx. 7 to 8 years) Fagus sylvatica L. trees were collected at a natural regeneration forest with intact roots with original forest soil and litter layer. Trees were kept outdoors under ambient conditions, protected from rain but regularly watered with demineralized water (to keep soil moisture content at approx. 0.32 m³ water per m³ soil) and a shading net to simulate natural forest light conditions. Trees were randomly relocated on a weekly basis throughout the experiment to avoid confounding location or light effects. Trees were kept this way from March 7th to July 30th. In the Morning (ca. 7:00 am) of the two treatment days, 60 mL of either deionized water, 20 mM 15KNO3 solution or 20 mM 15NH4Cl solution were added to each treatment tree of the control group and the two treatment groups, respectively (120 mL total). Trees were harvested on day 3. RNA was extracted using the CTAB method of Chang et al. (1993). mRNA libraries were constructed using the NEBNext RNA Ultra II Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol.		PRJEB37750			Sample 7
